== Description ==

= Social Login Plugin =

Social Login is a **professionally developed** and free Wordpress plugin that allows your visitors to **comment, login and register with 40+ Social Networks** like for example Facebook, Twitter, Google, LinkedIn, PayPal, LiveJournal, Instagram, Вконтакте or Yahoo amongst other.

**Data Protection Guarantee**<br />
Social Login is fully compliant with all European and U.S. data protection laws. As required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) the OneAll Terms of Service include a Data Processing Agreement that we can countersign on request.

**Seamless Integration**<br />
Social Login is fully customizable and seamlessly integrates with your existing login/registration system so that your users don't have to start from scratch. Existing existing accounts can add/remove their social network accounts in their WordPress profile settings and then also use the linked social networks to login.

**Eliminates Spam and Bot Registrations**<br />
Get rid of long and complicated forms, improve your data quality and instantly eliminate spam and bot registrations. Social Login increases registration rates by up to 50% and provides permission-based access to users' social network profile data, allowing you to start delivering a personalized experience.

**Maintenance Free**<br />
Do not take the risk of losing any users or customers due to outdated social network integrations. Unlike other Social Login providers we monitor the APIs and technologies of the different social networks and update our service as soon as changes arise.

By using OneAll you can be sure that your social media integration will always run smoothly and with the most up-to-date calls.

**Fully Customizable**<br />
You can easily configure which social accounts to enable/disable for social login and on which areas of the website the social login icons should be displayed:
* On the comment formular
* On the login page
* On the registration page
* In your sidebar
* With a shortcode

**Fully Compatible With Other Plugins**<br />
Social Login uses standard WordPress hooks and is compatible with all plugins that follow WordPress coding conventions, 
like per example BuddyPress or WooCommerce amongst others.

**Data Export**<br />
Easily export your users or automatically push data of users that login using Social Login to Mailchimp or Campaign Monitor.
This feature is available in the premium version of Social Login and can be enabled in your OneAll account.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I have to add template tags to my theme? =

You should not have to change your templates. 
The Social Login plugin seamlessly integrates into your blog by using standard WordPress hooks.

= Can Social Login be embedded through a shortcode? =

The Social Login shortcode `[oa_social_login]` can be used in any page or post within your WordPress blog.
The shortcode will automatically be replaced by the icons of the social networks that you have
enabled in the Social Login settings in your WordPress administration area.

= I have a custom template and the plugin is not displayed correctly =

Social Login uses standard WordPress hooks. If your theme does not support these hooks,
you can add the Social Login form manually to your theme by inserting the following code 
in your template (at the location where it should be displayed, i.e. above the comments).

`<?php do_action('oa_social_login'); ?>`

Do not hesitate to contact us if you need further assistance. 

= My users cannot login or leave comment with VKontakte (Вконтакте) =

Per default WordPress does not allow the use of special characters in usernames.
If you encounter any problems with users having cyrillic characters in their
usernames, please consider installing the following plugin to fix the problem:
<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-special-characters-in-usernames/">Wordpress Special Characters In Usernames</a>

= Do I have to change my Rewrite Settings? =

Social Login does not rely on mod_rewrite and does not need any additional rules.
It should work out of the box.
